# Stock-Price-Prediction_AI-Project
Functioning as a data-driven platform, it employs the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to forecast stock prices across diverse financial assets and aims to provide users with valuable insights into potential future stock price movements.

<b><h1>Prediction Using LSTM</h1></b>
<b><h1>Overview</h1></b>
Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM project! This repository houses a powerful Python-based algorithm that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze historical stock data and provide predictive insights into a company's future stock price movements. This tool is designed to assist investors, traders, and financial analysts in making data-driven decisions in the volatile world of stock markets.

<b><h1>Key Features</h1></b>
<ul>
  <li>Historical Data Analysis: The algorithm processes historical stock price data to identify intricate patterns, trends, and historical stock price fluctuations.</li>
  <li>LSTM Neural Networks: Utilizing LSTM architecture, our model excels at capturing long-term dependencies and complex relationships within stock price time series data.</li>
  <li>Accurate Predictions: The model offers predictive capabilities, aiding users in anticipating potential future stock price trends with a high degree of accuracy.</li>
  <li>Interactive Visualization: Easily visualize historical stock price trends and predictions with comprehensive chart graphs for a deeper understanding of a company's stock performance.</li>
</ul>
